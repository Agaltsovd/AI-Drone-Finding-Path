# AI-Flying-Car-Finding-Path
In this project, drone agent  will find paths through an urban  environment, both to reach a particular location and to cover a set of specified locations along the path. I built general search algorithms and applied them to this path planning problem. 

Algortihms Implemented:
- Depth-first search algorithm
-  Iterative deepening A* search algorithm
-  Uniform cost search algorithm
-  Algorithm with different  heuristics for A*search algorithm
-  Breadth-first search algorithm with graph search
-  A* search for traversing 3 fixed points
